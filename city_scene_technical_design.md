## Detailed Component Design

### SceneManager
Responsible for initializing and managing the Three.js scene, renderer, and core rendering loop.

```javascript
class SceneManager {
  constructor() {
    this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
    this.renderer = null;
    this.stats = null; // For performance monitoring
    this.clock = new THREE.Clock();
  }
  
  initialize(container) {
    // Initialize renderer with container element
    // Set up scene background, fog, etc.
    // Setup stats monitor
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Called each frame to update scene components
  }
  
  render() {
    // Render the scene
  }
  
  resize(width, height) {
    // Handle window resize events
  }
}
```

### BuildingManager
Handles the generation and management of all building structures in the city.

```javascript
class BuildingManager {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.buildings = [];
    this.buildingTypes = {
      SKYSCRAPER: 'skyscraper',
      APARTMENT: 'apartment',
      SHOP: 'shop'
    };
    this.materialLibrary = {}; // Cached materials for buildings
  }
  
  initialize(citySize, blockCount) {
    // Set up the building grid based on city size and block count
    // Initialize material library
  }
  
  createBuilding(type, position, size) {
    // Factory method to create different building types
    // Returns a BuildingObject
  }
  
  generateCityBlocks() {
    // Create city blocks with appropriate building distribution
  }
  
  update(deltaTime, isNight) {
    // Update building features (window lights, etc.)
  }
}

class Building {
  constructor(type, geometry, materials, position) {
    this.type = type;
    this.mesh = null;
    this.windows = [];
    this.lights = [];
  }
  
  createMesh(geometry, materials) {
    // Create Three.js mesh for the building
  }
  
  addDetails() {
    // Add architectural details based on building type
  }
  
  setNightLighting(isActive) {
    // Toggle window lights based on time of day
  }
}
```

### RoadNetwork
Manages the road system, including road segments, intersections, and traffic signals.

```javascript
class RoadNetwork {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.roads = [];
    this.intersections = [];
    this.trafficLights = [];
    this.pedestrianCrossings = [];
  }
  
  generateGrid(citySize, blockSize) {
    // Create a grid of roads based on city parameters
  }
  
  createRoadSegment(start, end, width) {
    // Create a road segment between two points
  }
  
  createIntersection(position, roads) {
    // Create an intersection where roads meet
  }
  
  addTrafficLight(intersection) {
    // Add traffic light to an intersection
    // Returns a TrafficLight object
  }
  
  addPedestrianCrossing(road, position) {
    // Add a pedestrian crossing to a road segment
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update traffic light states
  }
  
  getPath(startPoint, endPoint) {
    // Pathfinding for vehicles and pedestrians
    // Returns array of waypoints
  }
}

class TrafficLight {
  constructor(position, orientation) {
    this.position = position;
    this.orientation = orientation;
    this.state = 'red'; // red, yellow, green
    this.timer = 0;
    this.cycleDuration = { red: 10, yellow: 2, green: 8 };
    this.mesh = null;
  }
  
  createMesh() {
    // Create traffic light 3D model
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update light state based on timer
  }
  
  setState(state) {
    // Set light state and update visual appearance
  }
}
```

### VehicleSystem
Manages vehicle creation, movement, and traffic behaviors.

```javascript
class VehicleSystem {
  constructor(scene, roadNetwork) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.roadNetwork = roadNetwork;
    this.vehicles = [];
    this.vehicleTypes = ['sedan', 'suv', 'truck', 'bus'];
    this.maxVehicles = 50; // Limit for performance
  }
  
  initialize() {
    // Set up vehicle system
    // Create initial pool of vehicles
  }
  
  createVehicle(type) {
    // Factory method to create a vehicle of specified type
    // Returns a Vehicle object
  }
  
  spawnVehicle(roadSegment) {
    // Spawn a vehicle at a valid road entry point
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update all vehicle positions and behaviors
    // Manage vehicle lifecycle (creation/removal)
  }
}

class Vehicle {
  constructor(type, model) {
    this.type = type;
    this.mesh = model;
    this.speed = 0;
    this.maxSpeed = 0; // Varies by vehicle type
    this.path = []; // Array of waypoints
    this.currentWaypoint = 0;
  }
  
  setPath(waypoints) {
    // Set movement path for the vehicle
  }
  
  update(deltaTime, trafficLights, otherVehicles) {
    // Update position based on speed and path
    // Handle traffic light rules
    // Implement basic collision avoidance
  }
  
  checkTrafficLight(position) {
    // Check if approaching traffic light and act accordingly
  }
}
```

### PedestrianSystem
Manages pedestrian creation, movement, and behaviors.

```javascript
class PedestrianSystem {
  constructor(scene, roadNetwork) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.roadNetwork = roadNetwork;
    this.pedestrians = [];
    this.maxPedestrians = 100; // Limit for performance
  }
  
  initialize() {
    // Set up pedestrian system
    // Create initial pool of pedestrians
  }
  
  createPedestrian(position) {
    // Create a pedestrian at specified position
    // Returns a Pedestrian object
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update all pedestrian positions and behaviors
    // Manage pedestrian lifecycle
  }
}

class Pedestrian {
  constructor(model) {
    this.mesh = model;
    this.speed = 0.8 + Math.random() * 0.4; // Walking speed variation
    this.path = []; // Array of waypoints
    this.currentWaypoint = 0;
    this.state = 'walking'; // walking, waiting, crossing
  }
  
  setPath(waypoints) {
    // Set movement path for the pedestrian
  }
  
  update(deltaTime, trafficLights) {
    // Update position based on speed and path
    // Handle crosswalk behavior with traffic lights
    // Implement collision avoidance with other pedestrians
  }
  
  checkCrossing(position) {
    // Check if at pedestrian crossing and act accordingly
  }
}
```

### EnvironmentManager
Handles environmental elements like trees, lampposts, benches, etc.

```javascript
class EnvironmentManager {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.elements = {
      trees: [],
      lampposts: [],
      benches: []
    };
    this.templates = {}; // Stored geometries for instancing
  }
  
  initialize() {
    // Create templates for environment objects
    // Set up instanced meshes for performance
  }
  
  populateEnvironment(citySize, roadNetwork) {
    // Place environmental elements throughout the city
    this.placeTrees();
    this.placeLampposts();
    this.placeBenches();
  }
  
  placeTrees() {
    // Place trees along sidewalks and in green spaces
  }
  
  placeLampposts() {
    // Place lampposts along streets
  }
  
  placeBenches() {
    // Place benches at suitable locations
  }
  
  update(deltaTime, isNight) {
    // Update environmental elements (e.g., lamppost lights)
  }
}
```

### LightingSystem
Manages all lighting aspects, including day/night cycle.

```javascript
class LightingSystem {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.sunLight = null; // Main directional light
    this.ambientLight = null;
    this.streetLights = [];
    this.timeOfDay = 0; // 0-24 representing hours
    this.dayDuration = 300; // Seconds for a full day cycle
    this.isNight = false;
  }
  
  initialize() {
    // Set up lighting system
    // Create sun, ambient light, etc.
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update time of day
    // Update lighting based on time
    // Handle day/night transitions
  }
  
  updateSunPosition() {
    // Move the sun based on time of day
  }
  
  setNightMode(isNight) {
    // Transition to night lighting
    // Enable street lamps and building lights
  }
}
```

### CameraController
Handles camera positioning and user controls.

```javascript
class CameraController {
  constructor(camera, domElement) {
    this.camera = camera;
    this.domElement = domElement;
    this.controls = null; // OrbitControls or similar
    this.presetPositions = {}; // Named camera positions
  }
  
  initialize() {
    // Set up camera and controls
    // Define preset viewpoints
  }
  
  setupControls() {
    // Initialize OrbitControls or custom controls
  }
  
  moveTo(position, target, duration) {
    // Smoothly move camera to new position
  }
  
  setPreset(presetName) {
    // Move camera to a predefined preset position
  }
  
  update(deltaTime) {
    // Update camera controls
    // Handle any ongoing camera animations
  }
}
```

## Key Algorithms and Techniques

### Procedural Building Generation
Buildings will be generated using a parametric approach:

1. Define building parameters (height, width, depth, style)
2. Create base geometry (box)
3. Subdivide facades based on floor count and window patterns
4. Add architectural details (cornices, rooftop structures)
5. Apply materials based on building type

### Road Network Generation
A grid-based approach for city layout:

1. Define city bounds and block size
2. Create grid of roads with specified width
3. Identify intersections where roads meet
4. Place traffic lights at intersections
5. Add pedestrian crossings at appropriate intervals

### Traffic System
A simple state machine for traffic signals:

1. Define cycle durations for each light state (red, yellow, green)
2. Coordinate opposing traffic directions
3. Synchronize pedestrian crossing signals with traffic lights

### Vehicle Pathfinding
A waypoint system for vehicle navigation:

1. Vehicles follow predefined paths along road networks
2. At intersections, choose next road segment based on simple rules
3. Implement collision detection with simplified bounding boxes
4. Use raycasting for traffic light detection

### Time of Day System
Smooth transitions between day and night:

1. Interpolate sun position based on time of day
2. Adjust light color temperature (warm at sunrise/sunset, cool at midday)
3. Control intensity of ambient light
4. Trigger building window lights and street lamps at dusk

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Geometry Instancing
Use THREE.InstancedMesh for repeated elements:
- Trees, lampposts, benches
- Similar vehicle types
- Common building components

### Level of Detail (LOD)
Implement THREE.LOD for distant objects:
1. High-detail models when close to camera
2. Simplified geometry when far from camera
3. Billboard sprites for very distant objects

### Object Pooling
Reuse object instances instead of creating/destroying:
1. Maintain pools of vehicles and pedestrians
2. Deactivate off-screen objects
3. Respawn objects at new locations when needed

### Spatial Partitioning
Optimize collision detection and visibility:
1. Divide city into sectors
2. Only process objects in visible sectors
3. Use quadtree or similar structure for spatial queries

### Batching and Merging
Reduce draw calls:
1. Merge static geometry where possible
2. Use texture atlases for diverse materials
3. Batch similar materials

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Performance with Many Dynamic Objects

**Solution:**
- Limit maximum number of active vehicles and pedestrians
- Use instanced rendering for similar objects
- Implement aggressive LOD and culling
- Process AI logic at staggered intervals (not every object every frame)

### Challenge: Realistic Traffic Behavior

**Solution:**
- Implement simplified traffic rules using state machines
- Use influence maps for congestion awareness
- Create predefined paths with decision points
- Focus on visible behaviors rather than perfect simulation

### Challenge: Dynamic Lighting Performance

**Solution:**
- Limit number of realtime lights (1 sun + limited street lights)
- Bake lighting into textures where possible
- Use emissive materials for glowing windows at night
- Optimize shadows for critical objects only

### Challenge: Pedestrian Crowd Behavior

**Solution:**
- Use flocking algorithm with simplified rules
- Implement basic collision avoidance with spatial grid
- Focus on group behaviors rather than individual AI
- Use animation blending for smooth transitions

## Implementation Approach

2. Implement city layout and road network
3. Add basic building generation
4. Integrate vehicle system with simple movement
