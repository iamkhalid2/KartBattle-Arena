# Dr. Driving-Like Game Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
### Tasks:
- Define core gameplay mechanics (driving, traffic, missions, etc.).
- Choose development stack: **Three.js** for rendering, **Cannon.js** for physics.
- Set up the development environment (Node.js, Vite/Webpack for bundling if needed).
- Initialize a basic Three.js project structure.

## Phase 2: Basic 3D Scene & Car Physics
### Tasks:
- Create a **basic 3D city layout** with procedural roads and intersections.
- Implement **car model** using Three.js primitives (`BoxGeometry`, `CylinderGeometry`).
- Integrate **basic vehicle physics** (acceleration, braking, steering, collisions) using Cannon.js.
- Implement a **third-person camera system** that follows the car.

## Phase 3: Traffic System & AI Vehicles
### Tasks:
- Generate **procedural AI vehicles** using Three.js primitives.
- Implement a **basic traffic pathfinding system**.
- Add **traffic light signals** and make AI vehicles obey them.
- Detect collisions and prevent AI cars from overlapping.

## Phase 4: UI & Controls
### Tasks:
- Implement **speedometer, fuel gauge, and mini-map**.
- Add **keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys)** for desktop.
- Implement **touch controls** for mobile compatibility.
- Add a simple **HUD overlay** for mission tracking.

## Phase 5: Gameplay Mechanics
### Tasks:
- Add **mission system** (e.g., parking, time-based delivery challenges).
- Implement a **fuel system** that requires refueling at gas stations.
- Add a **penalty system** for traffic violations (e.g., running red lights).

## Phase 6: Environment & Immersion
### Tasks:
- Implement **day/night cycle** with real-time lighting.
- Implement **sound effects** for engine noise, braking, honking, and ambient city sounds.
- Add **dynamic pedestrians** walking on sidewalks.

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization
### Tasks:
- Optimize **rendering performance** (Level of Detail (LoD), culling, efficient material usage).
- Reduce CPU/GPU load for AI traffic.
- Optimize physics performance by limiting collision calculations.
- Ensure smooth performance across different devices.

## Phase 8: Deployment & Final Testing
### Tasks:
- Final bug fixes and polishing.
- Implement **game save/load system** (optional).
- Deploy to a **static site hosting platform** (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).
- Test on **multiple browsers and devices** to ensure compatibility.
