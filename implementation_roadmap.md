## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Implement one phase at a time
- Test thoroughly before moving to the next phase
- Use placeholder elements for unimplemented systems
- Continuously monitor performance

### Testing Strategy
- Test each component in isolation
- Verify integration with existing components
- Check performance impact of each new feature
- Use Chrome DevTools for performance profiling

### Version Control
- Commit working versions at the completion of each step
- Create branches for experimental features
- Use descriptive commit messages

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- Optimize for desktop first, then consider mobile compatibility
- Monitor memory usage to prevent leaks

### Extensions and Future Enhancements
After completing the core implementation, consider these potential enhancements:
1. Interactive elements (clickable buildings)
2. Advanced weather system
3. Day/night cycle with accelerated time
4. First-person navigation mode
5. Mini-map and navigation tools
