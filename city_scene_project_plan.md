# 3D City Scene Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive 3D city environment using Three.js that includes:
- Urban buildings (skyscrapers, apartment buildings, shops)
- Road networks with moving vehicles
- Traffic systems (lights, crossings)
- Pedestrians with basic AI
- Environmental elements (lampposts, benches, trees)
- Dynamic day/night lighting cycle
- Interactive camera controls

## Technical Stack
- **Three.js** - Core 3D rendering library
- **JavaScript** - Programming language
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Structure and styling
- **Webpack** - Module bundling (optional)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Scene
- Initialize project structure
- Create basic HTML/CSS structure
- Set up Three.js scene, renderer, and camera
- Implement basic camera controls
- Create a simple ground plane

### Phase 2: Building Generation System
- Develop procedural building generation system
- Create different building types:
  - Skyscrapers (tall with variable heights)
  - Apartment buildings (medium height, complex facades)
  - Shops (ground level with detailed fronts)
- Arrange buildings in a grid/block structure
- Add texture variations for visual diversity

### Phase 3: Road Network & Infrastructure
- Create road network layout system
- Implement sidewalks alongside roads
- Add road markings (lanes, crossings)
- Create traffic light system with state management
- Add street elements:
  - Lampposts with functional lights
  - Benches placed strategically
  - Trees and small green areas

### Phase 4: Vehicle System
- Create basic vehicle models (cars, buses, trucks)
- Implement vehicle movement along roads
- Add traffic rules (following lanes, stopping at lights)
- Create basic collision avoidance

### Phase 5: Pedestrian System
- Develop pedestrian models with variations
- Implement pedestrian movement along sidewalks
- Add street crossing behavior at designated crossings
- Create simple crowd behaviors

### Phase 6: Lighting & Environment
- Implement dynamic lighting system
- Create day/night cycle with smooth transitions
- Add ambient lighting and shadows
- Implement building window lights that activate at night
- Add street lamps that illuminate during night hours

### Phase 7: Optimization & Polish
- Optimize rendering performance
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) system
- Add atmospheric effects (fog, haze)
- Fine-tune camera controls
- Add user interface elements (if needed)

## Technical Approach Details

### Building Generation
We'll use a procedural approach to generate buildings, with parameters controlling:
- Building height, width, and depth
- Number of floors and windows
- Texture and material selection
- Architectural features (balconies, rooftop structures)

Buildings will be organized into city blocks with appropriate spacing for roads.

### Road System
Roads will be created using plane geometries with appropriate textures. The system will:
- Generate a grid-based network of roads
- Include intersections with traffic lights
- Have designated pedestrian crossings
- Support vehicle pathfinding

### Vehicle Movement
Vehicles will follow predefined paths along roads and will:
- Move at varying speeds
- Stop at red traffic lights
- Avoid basic collisions with other vehicles
- Turn at intersections

### Pedestrian AI
Pedestrians will have simple AI that allows them to:
- Walk along sidewalks
- Wait at crossings for lights to change
- Cross roads when safe
- Avoid collisions with other pedestrians

### Lighting System
The lighting system will include:
- Directional light (sun/moon)
- Ambient light for general illumination
- Point lights for street lamps and building windows
- Dynamic transitions between day and night states

### Camera Controls
We'll implement controls that allow users to:
- Pan across the city
- Zoom in and out
- Orbit around points of interest
- Switch between predetermined viewpoints

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance, we'll implement:
- Object pooling for vehicles and pedestrians
- Instance meshes for repetitive elements (trees, lampposts)
- Level-of-detail (LOD) for distant buildings
- Visibility culling for off-screen objects
- Texture atlasing to reduce draw calls
- Optimized lighting with strategic light placement

## Extensions (If Time Permits)
- Weather effects (rain, snow)
- Sound effects and ambient audio
- More diverse building types
- Advanced traffic simulation with traffic jams
- Interactive elements (clickable buildings, vehicles)
- Mini-map navigation
- First-person navigation mode
