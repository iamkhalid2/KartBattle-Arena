# KartBattle.io

A fast-paced, multiplayer battle kart game where players drive go-karts, collect weapons, and eliminate opponents in an arena-style deathmatch, built with Three.js and TypeScript.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**KartBattle.io** is a browser-based 3D battle kart game. Players control customizable go-karts in various arenas, collecting weapons and power-ups while trying to eliminate opponents. The core gameplay revolves around driving skills, strategic weapon use, and avoiding enemy attacks.

### Core Game Mechanics
- **Third-person driving** with physics-based controls including drifting
- **Weapon pickups** and strategic combat
- **Arena-style maps** with hazards and power-ups
- **Real-time multiplayer** with matchmaking
- **Customizable karts** and characters

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Plan

- [ ] Add area-effect weapons (mines, bombs)
- [ ] Implement defensive items (shields, speed boosts)
- [ ] Create weapon visual effects and animations
- [ ] Add sound effects for weapons and pickups
- [ ] Implement damage system and kart destruction effects

### Phase 3: Arena Design and Game Modes
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

- [ ] Design multiple battle arena maps
- [ ] Implement dynamic obstacles and hazards
- [ ] Create spawn points and respawn logic
- [ ] Add match timing system and scoreboard
- [ ] Implement game modes:
  - [ ] Deathmatch
  - [ ] Team Battle
  - [ ] Capture the Flag
- [ ] Add end-of-match statistics and rewards
- [ ] Implement AI opponents for single-player mode

### Phase 4: Networking and Multiplayer
**Timeline: 3-4 weeks**

- [ ] Set up WebSocket server for real-time communication
- [ ] Implement client-server architecture
- [ ] Add player authentication and profiles
- [ ] Create matchmaking system
- [ ] Implement network synchronization for:
  - [ ] Player positions and physics
  - [ ] Weapon firing and hit detection
  - [ ] Item box states
- [ ] Add latency compensation techniques
- [ ] Create private lobby system for friends
- [ ] Implement chat functionality

### Phase 5: Progression and Customization
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

- [ ] Design player progression system (XP, levels)
- [ ] Implement unlockable content:
  - [ ] Kart bodies and parts
  - [ ] Paint jobs and decals
  - [ ] Character skins
- [ ] Create garage/customization UI
- [ ] Add achievements and challenges
- [ ] Implement virtual economy (optional)
- [ ] Create player profile pages

### Phase 6: Polish, Optimization and Launch
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

- [ ] Optimize rendering for various devices
- [ ] Implement LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant objects
- [ ] Add advanced visual effects (bloom, motion blur, etc.)
- [ ] Create tutorial system for new players
- [ ] Polish UI/UX across all screens
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing (performance, balance, fun)
- [ ] Implement analytics and monitoring
- [ ] Prepare launch strategy and marketing materials
